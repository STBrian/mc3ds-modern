I see the player you mean. | h22 #00FFFF
| h22
PLAYERNAME? | h22 #00FF00
| h22
Yes. Take care. | h22 #00FFFF
It has reached a higher | h22 #00FFFF
level now. | h22 #00FFFF
It can read our thoughts. | h22 #00FFFF
| h22
That doesn't matter. | h22 #00FF00
It thinks we are | h22 #00FF00
part of the game. | h22 #00FF00
| h22
I like this player. | h22 #00FFFF
It played well. | h22 #00FFFF
It did not give up. | h22 #00FFFF
| h22
It is reading our thoughts | h22 #00FF00
as though they | h22 #00FF00
were words on a screen. | h22 #00FF00
| h22
That is how it chooses | h22 #00FFFF
to imagine many things, | h22 #00FFFF
when it is deep | h22 #00FFFF
in the dream of a game. | h22 #00FFFF
| h22
Words make a | h22 #00FF00
wonderful interface. | h22 #00FF00
Very flexible. | h22 #00FF00
And less terrifying than | h22 #00FF00
staring at the reality | h22 #00FF00
behind the screen. | h22 #00FF00
| h22
They used to hear voices. | h22 #00FFFF
Before players | h22 #00FFFF
could read. Back in the days | h22 #00FFFF
when those who | h22 #00FFFF
did not play | h22 #00FFFF
called the players witches, | h22 #00FFFF
and warlocks. | h22 #00FFFF
And players dreamed they flew | h22 #00FFFF
through the air, | h22 #00FFFF
on sticks powered by demons. | h22 #00FFFF
| h22
What did this player dream? | h22 #00FF00
| h22
This player dreamed | h22 #00FFFF
of sunlight and trees. | h22 #00FFFF
Of fire and water. | h22 #00FFFF
It dreamed it created. And it | h22 #00FFFF
dreamed it destroyed. | h22 #00FFFF
It dreamed it hunted, | h22 #00FFFF
and was hunted. | h22 #00FFFF
It dreamed of shelter. | h22 #00FFFF
| h22
Hah, the original interface. | h22 #00FF00
A million years | h22 #00FF00
old, and it still works. | h22 #00FF00
But what true | h22 #00FF00
structure did this | h22 #00FF00
player create, in the | h22 #00FF00
reality behind the screen? | h22 #00FF00
| h22
It worked, with a million others, | h22 #00FFFF
to sculpt a true world | h22 #00FFFF
in a fold | h22 #00FFFF
of the XXXXXXXX, | h22 #00FFFF SCRAMBLE
and created a XXXXXXXX | h22 #00FFFF SCRAMBLE
for XXXXXXXX, | h22 #00FFFF SCRAMBLE
in the XXXXXXXX. | h22 #00FFFF SCRAMBLE
| h22
It cannot read that thought. | h22 #00FF00
| h22
No. It has not yet | h22 #00FFFF
achieved the highest level. | h22 #00FFFF
That, it must achieve | h22 #00FFFF
in the long dream of life, | h22 #00FFFF
not the short dream | h22 #00FFFF
of a game. | h22 #00FFFF
| h22
Does it know that we love it? | h22 #00FF00
That the | h22 #00FF00
universe is kind? | h22 #00FF00
| h22
Sometimes, through the noise | h22 #00FFFF
of its thoughts, | h22 #00FFFF
it hears the universe, yes. | h22 #00FFFF
| h22
But there are times it is sad, | h22 #00FF00
in the long dream. | h22 #00FF00
It creates worlds | h22 #00FF00
that have no summer, | h22 #00FF00
and it shivers | h22 #00FF00
under a black sun, | h22 #00FF00
and it takes its | h22 #00FF00
sad creation for reality. | h22 #00FF00
| h22
To cure it of sorrow | h22 #00FFFF
would destroy it. | h22 #00FFFF
The sorrow is part of | h22 #00FFFF
its own private task. | h22 #00FFFF
We cannot interfere. | h22 #00FFFF
| h22
Sometimes when they | h22 #00FF00
are deep in dreams, I | h22 #00FF00
want to tell them, | h22 #00FF00
they are building true | h22 #00FF00
worlds in reality. | h22 #00FF00
Sometimes I want to tell | h22 #00FF00
them of their importance | h22 #00FF00
to the universe. | h22 #00FF00
Sometimes, when they | h22 #00FF00
have not made a true | h22 #00FF00
connection in a while, | h22 #00FF00
I want to help them | h22 #00FF00
to speak the word | h22 #00FF00
they fear. | h22 #00FF00
| h22
It reads our thoughts. | h22 #00FFFF
| h22
Sometimes I do not care. | h22 #00FF00
Sometimes I wish | h22 #00FF00
to tell them, | h22 #00FF00
this world you | h22 #00FF00
take for truth | h22 #00FF00
is merely XXXXXXXX | h22 #00FF00 SCRAMBLE
and XXXXXXXX, | h22 #00FF00 SCRAMBLE
I wish to tell them | h22 #00FF00
that they are XXXXXXXX | h22 #00FF00 SCRAMBLE
in the XXXXXXXX. | h22 #00FF00 SCRAMBLE
They see so little of | h22 #00FF00
reality, in their long dream. | h22 #00FF00
| h22
And yet they play the game. | h22 #00FFFF
| h22
But it would be so | h22 #00FF00
easy to tell them... | h22 #00FF00
| h22
Too strong for this dream. | h22 #00FFFF
To tell them | h22 #00FFFF
how to live is to | h22 #00FFFF
prevent them living. | h22 #00FFFF
| h22
I will not tell the | h22 #00FF00
player how to live. | h22 #00FF00
| h22
The player is growing | h22 #00FFFF
restless. | h22 #00FFFF
| h22
I will tell the player | h22 #00FF00
a story. | h22 #00FF00
| h22
But not the truth. | h22 #00FFFF
| h22
No. A story that contains | h22 #00FF00
the truth safely, | h22 #00FF00
in a cage of words. | h22 #00FF00
Not the naked truth | h22 #00FF00
that can burn | h22 #00FF00
over any distance. | h22 #00FF00
| h22
Give it a body, again. | h22 #00FFFF
| h22
Yes. Player... | h22 #00FF00
| h22
Use its name. | h22 #00FFFF
| h22
PLAYERNAME. | h22 #00FF00
Player of games. | h22 #00FF00
| h22
Good. | h22 #00FFFF
| h22
Take a breath, now. | h22 #00FF00
Take another. Feel air | h22 #00FF00
in your lungs. | h22 #00FF00
Let your limbs return. Yes, | h22 #00FF00
move your fingers. | h22 #00FF00
Have a body again, under | h22 #00FF00
gravity, in air. | h22 #00FF00
Respawn in the long dream. | h22 #00FF00
There you are. | h22 #00FF00
Your body touching the | h22 #00FF00
universe again at every | h22 #00FF00
point, as though | h22 #00FF00
you were separate things. | h22 #00FF00
As though we | h22 #00FF00
were separate things. | h22 #00FF00
| h22
Who are we? | h22 #00FFFF
Once we were called | h22 #00FFFF
the spirit of the mountain. | h22 #00FFFF
Father sun, mother moon. | h22 #00FFFF
Ancestral spirits, | h22 #00FFFF
animal spirits. | h22 #00FFFF
Jinn. | h22 #00FFFF
Ghosts. The green man. | h22 #00FFFF
Then gods, demons. | h22 #00FFFF
Angels. Poltergeists. | h22 #00FFFF
Aliens, | h22 #00FFFF
extraterrestrials. | h22 #00FFFF
Leptons, quarks. | h22 #00FFFF
The words change. | h22 #00FFFF
We do not change. | h22 #00FFFF
| h22
We are the universe. | h22 #00FF00
We are everything you | h22 #00FF00
think isn't you. | h22 #00FF00
You are looking at us now, | h22 #00FF00
through your skin | h22 #00FF00
and your eyes. And why | h22 #00FF00
does the universe | h22 #00FF00
touch your skin, and | h22 #00FF00
throw light on you? | h22 #00FF00
To see you, player. | h22 #00FF00
To know you. | h22 #00FF00
And to be known. | h22 #00FF00
I shall | h22 #00FF00
tell you a story. | h22 #00FF00
| h22
Once upon a time, | h22 #00FFFF
there was a player. | h22 #00FFFF
| h22
The player was you, | h22 #00FF00
PLAYERNAME. | h22 #00FF00
| h22
Sometimes it thought | h22 #00FFFF
itself human, on the | h22 #00FFFF
thin crust of a spinning | h22 #00FFFF
globe of molten rock. | h22 #00FFFF
The ball of molten rock | h22 #00FFFF
circled a ball of | h22 #00FFFF
blazing gas that was | h22 #00FFFF
three hundred and thirty | h22 #00FFFF
thousand times more | h22 #00FFFF
massive than it. | h22 #00FFFF
They were so far apart | h22 #00FFFF
that light took | h22 #00FFFF
eight minutes to cross the gap. | h22 #00FFFF
The light | h22 #00FFFF
was information from a star, | h22 #00FFFF
and it could | h22 #00FFFF
burn your skin from | h22 #00FFFF
a hundred and fifty | h22 #00FFFF
million kilometres away. | h22 #00FFFF
| h22
Sometimes the player | h22 #00FF00
dreamed it was a miner, | h22 #00FF00
on the surface of | h22 #00FF00
a world that was flat, | h22 #00FF00
and infinite. | h22 #00FF00
The sun was a square of white. | h22 #00FF00
The days were short; | h22 #00FF00
there was much to do; | h22 #00FF00
and death was a | h22 #00FF00
temporary inconvenience. | h22 #00FF00
| h22
Sometimes the player | h22 #00FFFF
dreamed it was | h22 #00FFFF
lost in a story. | h22 #00FFFF
| h22
Sometimes the player | h22 #00FF00
dreamed it was other | h22 #00FF00
things, in other places. | h22 #00FF00
Sometimes these | h22 #00FF00
dreams were disturbing. | h22 #00FF00
Sometimes very | h22 #00FF00
beautiful indeed. | h22 #00FF00
Sometimes the player | h22 #00FF00
woke from one dream | h22 #00FF00
into another, then | h22 #00FF00
woke from that into a third. | h22 #00FF00
| h22
Sometimes the player | h22 #00FFFF
dreamed it | h22 #00FFFF
watched words on a screen. | h22 #00FFFF
| h22
Let's go back. | h22 #00FF00
| h22
The atoms of the player | h22 #00FFFF
were scattered | h22 #00FFFF
in the grass, | h22 #00FFFF
in the rivers, | h22 #00FFFF
in the air, | h22 #00FFFF
in the ground. | h22 #00FFFF
A woman gathered the atoms; | h22 #00FFFF
she drank and ate and inhaled; | h22 #00FFFF
and the woman assembled | h22 #00FFFF
the player, in her body. | h22 #00FFFF
| h22
And the player awoke, | h22 #00FF00
from the warm, | h22 #00FF00
dark world of its | h22 #00FF00
mother's body, | h22 #00FF00
into the long dream. | h22 #00FF00
| h22
And the player was a | h22 #00FFFF
new story, never | h22 #00FFFF
told before, | h22 #00FFFF
written in letters of DNA. | h22 #00FFFF
And the player was a | h22 #00FFFF
new program, never | h22 #00FFFF
run before, | h22 #00FFFF
generated by a sourcecode | h22 #00FFFF
a billion years old. | h22 #00FFFF
And the player was a | h22 #00FFFF
new human, | h22 #00FFFF
never alive before, made | h22 #00FFFF
from nothing | h22 #00FFFF
but milk and love. | h22 #00FFFF
| h22
You are the player. | h22 #00FF00
The story. | h22 #00FF00
The program. | h22 #00FF00
The human. Made from | h22 #00FF00
nothing but milk and love. | h22 #00FF00
| h22
Let's go further back. | h22 #00FFFF
| h22
The seven | h22 #00FF00
billion billion billion | h22 #00FF00
atoms of the player's body | h22 #00FF00
were created, | h22 #00FF00
long before this game, | h22 #00FF00
in the heart | h22 #00FF00
of a star. | h22 #00FF00
So the player, too, is | h22 #00FF00
information from a star. | h22 #00FF00
And the player | h22 #00FF00
moves through a story, | h22 #00FF00
which is a forest | h22 #00FF00
of information planted | h22 #00FF00
by a man called | h22 #00FF00
Julian, on a flat, | h22 #00FF00
infinite world created | h22 #00FF00
by a man called Markus, | h22 #00FF00
that exists | h22 #00FF00
inside a small, | h22 #00FF00
private world created | h22 #00FF00
by the player, | h22 #00FF00
who inhabits a universe | h22 #00FF00
created by... | h22 #00FF00
| h22
Shush. | h22 #00FFFF
Sometimes the player created | h22 #00FFFF
a small, private world | h22 #00FFFF
that was soft | h22 #00FFFF
and warm and simple. | h22 #00FFFF
Sometimes hard, | h22 #00FFFF
and cold, and complicated. | h22 #00FFFF
Sometimes it | h22 #00FFFF
built a model of the | h22 #00FFFF
universe in its head; | h22 #00FFFF
flecks of energy, | h22 #00FFFF
moving through vast | h22 #00FFFF
empty spaces. | h22 #00FFFF
Sometimes it called those | h22 #00FFFF
flecks "electrons" | h22 #00FFFF
and "protons". | h22 #00FFFF
| h22
Sometimes it | h22 #00FF00
called them "planets" | h22 #00FF00
and "stars". | h22 #00FF00
| h22
Sometimes it believed | h22 #00FFFF
it was in a | h22 #00FFFF
universe that was made | h22 #00FFFF
of energy that | h22 #00FFFF
was made of offs and ons; | h22 #00FFFF
zeros and ones; | h22 #00FFFF
lines of code. | h22 #00FFFF
Sometimes it believed it | h22 #00FFFF
was playing a game. | h22 #00FFFF
Sometimes it believed | h22 #00FFFF
it was reading words | h22 #00FFFF
on a screen. | h22 #00FFFF
| h22
You are the player, | h22 #00FF00
reading words... | h22 #00FF00
| h22
Shush... | h22 #00FFFF
Sometimes the player | h22 #00FFFF
read lines | h22 #00FFFF
of code on a screen. | h22 #00FFFF
Decoded them into words; | h22 #00FFFF
decoded words into meaning; | h22 #00FFFF
decoded meaning into feelings, | h22 #00FFFF
emotions, theories, | h22 #00FFFF
ideas, and the player started | h22 #00FFFF
to breathe | h22 #00FFFF
faster and deeper | h22 #00FFFF
and realised it was alive, | h22 #00FFFF
it was alive, | h22 #00FFFF
those thousand deaths had | h22 #00FFFF
not been real, | h22 #00FFFF
the player was alive | h22 #00FFFF
| h22
You. | h22 #00FF00
You. You are alive. | h22 #00FF00
| h22
and sometimes the player | h22 #00FFFF
believed the | h22 #00FFFF
universe had spoken | h22 #00FFFF
to it through the | h22 #00FFFF
sunlight that came | h22 #00FFFF
through the shuffling | h22 #00FFFF
leaves of the summer trees | h22 #00FFFF
| h22
and sometimes the player | h22 #00FF00
believed the | h22 #00FF00
universe had spoken | h22 #00FF00
to it through the | h22 #00FF00
light that fell from | h22 #00FF00
the crisp night | h22 #00FF00
sky of winter, | h22 #00FF00
where a fleck of light | h22 #00FF00
in the corner of the | h22 #00FF00
player's eye might | h22 #00FF00
be a star a million times | h22 #00FF00
as massive as | h22 #00FF00
the sun, boiling its | h22 #00FF00
planets to plasma | h22 #00FF00
in order to be visible | h22 #00FF00
for a moment to | h22 #00FF00
the player, | h22 #00FF00
walking home at | h22 #00FF00
the far side | h22 #00FF00
of the universe, | h22 #00FF00
suddenly smelling food, | h22 #00FF00
almost at the familiar door, | h22 #00FF00
about to dream again | h22 #00FF00
| h22
and sometimes the player | h22 #00FFFF
believed the | h22 #00FFFF
universe had spoken | h22 #00FFFF
to it through the | h22 #00FFFF
zeros and ones, | h22 #00FFFF
through the electricity | h22 #00FFFF
of the world, | h22 #00FFFF
through the scrolling words | h22 #00FFFF
on a screen | h22 #00FFFF
at the end of a dream | h22 #00FFFF
| h22
and the universe | h22 #00FF00
said I love you | h22 #00FF00
| h22
and the universe | h22 #00FFFF
said you have | h22 #00FFFF
played the game well | h22 #00FFFF
| h22
and the universe | h22 #00FF00
said everything you | h22 #00FF00
need is within you | h22 #00FF00
| h22
and the universe | h22 #00FFFF
said you are stronger | h22 #00FFFF
than you know | h22 #00FFFF
| h22
and the universe | h22 #00FF00
said you are | h22 #00FF00
the daylight | h22 #00FF00
| h22
and the universe | h22 #00FFFF
said you | h22 #00FFFF
are the night | h22 #00FFFF
| h22
and the universe | h22 #00FF00
said the | h22 #00FF00
darkness you fight | h22 #00FF00
is within you | h22 #00FF00
| h22
and the universe | h22 #00FFFF
said the | h22 #00FFFF
light you seek is | h22 #00FFFF
within you | h22 #00FFFF
| h22
and the universe said | h22 #00FF00
you are not alone | h22 #00FF00
| h22
and the universe said | h22 #00FFFF
you are | h22 #00FFFF
not separate from | h22 #00FFFF
every other thing | h22 #00FFFF
| h22
and the universe said | h22 #00FF00
you are | h22 #00FF00
the universe tasting itself, | h22 #00FF00
talking to itself, | h22 #00FF00
reading its own code | h22 #00FF00
| h22
and the universe said | h22 #00FFFF
I love you | h22 #00FFFF
because you are love. | h22 #00FFFF
| h22
And the game was over | h22 #00FF00
and the player | h22 #00FF00
woke up from the dream. | h22 #00FF00
And the player | h22 #00FF00
began a new dream. | h22 #00FF00
And the player | h22 #00FF00
dreamed again, | h22 #00FF00
dreamed better. | h22 #00FF00
And the player | h22 #00FF00
was the universe. | h22 #00FF00
And the player | h22 #00FF00
was love. | h22 #00FF00
| h22
You are the player. | h22 #00FFFF
| h22
Wake up. | h22 #00FF00
