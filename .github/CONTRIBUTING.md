<i><b>Thank you for contributing to Modernization MegaPack! Please read the following before opening a pull request.</b></i>

<h1>CONTRIBUTING GUIDELINES</h1>

<br>

1. Pull requests that __add new mods__ to the modpack should not target the <i>main</i> branch. They should instead target the closest pre-release branch. For example, if the latest release is version 2.0.0 "Romantic," the pull request should target the <i>2.1.0-austen</i> branch.

<br>

2. Pull requests that __tweak existing functionality__ or make updates to content in the <i>mc3ds-modern/docs/</i> directory should target the <i>main</i> branch.

<br>

3. Please outline what exactly your pull request does so that the MegaPack's patch notes can be updated accordingly if necessary. 

<br>

4. __Please add any new files introduced in your pull request to the file index in appConfiguration.info!__

<br>

Lastly, please abide by the terms of the <i>Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct. (CCCoC)</i>
