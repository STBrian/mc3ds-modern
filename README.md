# Overview
This is a modpack for Minecraft: New Nintendo 3DS Edition that aims to modernize the game. This pack adds new texture packs (including a 100% conversion of the post-1.14 textures), a new look for the game's user interface and icons, the original Minecraft font, patches to improve the game's performance and the ability to swap between fonts at will in the Language menu.

# Installation
## Method 1
### Manual (Fastest) 
_Requires access to a microSD card reader_ **OR** _an FTP client._

1. Ensure that you have game patching enabled in your Luma settings by holding the Select button on startup. **If there is an '(x)' to the left of 'Enable game patching' in your Luma settings, then game patching is enabled.**
2. Download the latest release of Modernization MegaPack **for your region** from the [releases page](https://github.com/wyndchyme/mc3ds-modern/releases).
3. Extract the .zip file you downloaded and look for a folder that starts with **'0004'.** This is the folder you will move onto your console.
4. Open your console's microSD card using a microSD card reader or an FTP client.
5. On the root (highest level) of your microSD card, there should be a directory named 'luma'. Enter that directory and look for a directory named 'titles'. If the 'titles' directory is not present, create it.
6. Enter 'titles' and move the folder beginning with **'0004'** from step 3 into the 'titles' directory.
7. Launch Minecraft: New Nintendo 3DS Edition. If the game displays the new Mojang Studios logo (**not** the default black and red Mojang logo from the vanilla game) then the modpack has been applied successfully.

### MANUALLY UPDATING MODERNIZATION MEGAPACK

Delete the folder beginning with **'0004'** from the 'titles' directory and repeat the process above using the latest release. 

## Method 2
### UniStore (Automatic)
_Requires internet access on your New Nintendo 3DS system and Universal-Updater. Installation may take a long time, please be patient._

1. Ensure that you have game patching enabled in your Luma settings by holding the Select button on startup. **If there is an '(x)' to the left of 'Enable game patching' in your Luma settings, then game patching is enabled.**
2. Ensure that you have **Universal-Updater** installed on your console. [Universal-Updater can be downloaded here.](https://universal-team.net/projects/universal-updater)
3. Open Universal-Updater and press the Settings icon in the bottom left corner of the touch screen. Press **'Select UniStore...'**
4. At the bottom of the 'Select a UniStore' screen, press the + button. Select **'Minecraft 3DS Community Unistore'** on the 'Recommended UniStores'.
5. Return to the 'Select a UniStore' screen and select minecraft-3ds-community.unistore.
6. Find or search for Modernization MegaPack. Press 'A' while you have it selected. Select the correct download for your region from the 'Avaliable Downloads' screen.
7. Press the 'Queue' button on the touch screen (directly above the search button) and press 'Action required!'
8. Press 'Accept' when prompted.
9. Wait for Modernization MegaPack installation to complete. This may take a long time.
10. After installation is complete, quit Universal-Updater and launch Minecraft: New Nintendo 3DS Edition. If the game displays the new Mojang Studios logo (**not** the default black and red Mojang logo from the vanilla game) then the modpack has been applied successfully.

### UPDATING MODERNIZATION MEGAPACK WITH UNIVERSAL-UPDATER

In the Minecraft 3DS Community Unistore, navigate to 'Customization Removal' and press 'A' while you have it selected. Note that this will delete all mods you have installed. Reinstall Modernization MegaPack by repeating steps 5-10 above. Note that the UniStore may take some time to the latest version of Modernization MegaPack.

## Method 3
### Source Files (Not Recommended)
_Prerelease builds may be unstable or contain unfinished features. Not recommended for general use, please refer to Method 1 or 2._

1. Ensure that you have game patching enabled in your Luma settings by holding the Select button on startup. **If there is an '(x)' to the left of 'Enable game patching' in your Luma settings, then game patching is enabled.**
2. Open [Modernization MegaPack's GitHub repository.](https://github.com/wyndchyme/mc3ds-modern).
3. Select 'Code' and 'Download ZIP'.
4. Extract the .zip file you downloaded.
5. Create a folder called 'romfs'. Move all folders (excluding screenshots folder) that were in the zip you downloaded into this folder.
6. Create another folder with a name that corresponds to your region's Minecraft: New Nintendo 3DS Edition title ID. These title IDs are:
   - For USA:
   00040000001B8700
   - For EUR:
   000400000017CA00
   - For JPN:
   000400000017FD00
7. Move the 'romfs' folder you created earlier into the folder you created in step 6.
8. If you are in the USA region, move the file named 'code.ips' into the folder you created in step 6 as well. If you are in EUR or JPN, skip this step.
9. Open your console's microSD card using a microSD card reader or an FTP client.
10. On the root (highest level) of your microSD card, there should be a directory named 'luma'. Enter that directory and look for a directory named 'titles'. If the 'titles' directory is not present, create it.
11. Enter 'titles' and move the folder beginning with **'0004'** from step 6 into the 'titles' directory.
12. Launch Minecraft: New Nintendo 3DS Edition. If the game displays the new Mojang Studios logo (**not** the default black and red Mojang logo from the vanilla game) then the modpack has been applied successfully.

### UPDATING MODERNIZATION MEGAPACK FROM SOURCE FILES
**NOT RECOMMENDED**

Delete the folder beginning with **'0004'** from the 'titles' directory and repeat the above process.
# Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Does Modernization MegaPack affect world generation?**

_A: No, world generation is not affected so the pack retains 100% compatibility with the vanilla game._

**Q: Can Modernizaton MegaPack cause my game to crash?**

_A: Extremely unlikely – the way LayeredFS works and the current extent of Modernization MegaPack's changes mean that causing game crashes or performance issues is almost impossible. If you are having issues with the game repeatedly crashing on certain worlds, it is likely an issue with that world, your microSD card, or your console. You can also try deleting the "./luma/titles/mc3dsTitleID/code.ips" file in your mods folder and see if that helps._

**Q: Why does installation on the UniStore take so long?**

_A: The way the UniStore works is that it downloads the Modernization MegaPack .zip file and extracts each directory into its correct spot. The 3DS takes a long time to extract archived files, so this obviously takes longer than just moving the already extracted files onto your microSD card._

**Q: On the UniStore, downloading Modernization MegaPack causes the download to fail, or the changes aren't showing even though I have game patching enabled!**

_A: Ensure that your internet connection is working correctly. If it is, then this is likely an issue on the UniStore's end. File an issue on the [UniStore's GitHub repository.](https://github.com/Minecraft-3DS-Community/Minecraft-3ds-unistore/issues)_

**Q: I have a suggestion for Modernization MegaPack! Where can I put it?**

_A: File an issue [here.](https://github.com/wyndchyme/mc3ds-modern/issues)_
